💳 Credit Card Delinquency Early Warning System (Full-Stack MVP)🎯 Project OverviewThis project implements a real-time machine learning service designed to predict the probability of credit card delinquency using a minimal set of powerful behavioral and financial features. It is built as a Full-Stack Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a decoupled architecture.The project demonstrates a seamless transition from a simple classification model to a deployed API service with an interactive web frontend.🚀 ArchitectureThe system follows a three-tier architecture, allowing the model logic to be independent of the user interface.Backend API (FastAPI): Hosts the trained Logistic Regression model and serves predictions via an HTTP endpoint.Frontend App (Streamlit): Provides the interactive web interface, allowing users to input features and receive real-time risk scores.Model/Data Persistence: Uses joblib for model storage and CSV files for demonstration data.⚙️ How to Run the Project (Local Deployment)This project requires two separate terminals to run simultaneously.PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python and Docker Desktop installed and running.Install dependencies using the generated file:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Step 1: Start the Backend API (Terminal 1)The FastAPI server hosts the prediction model. It must be running continuously.Open Terminal 1.Run the API server:Bashuvicorn api_service:app --reload
Expected Output: The server will start, reporting success at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Keep this terminal open.Step 2: Start the Frontend App (Terminal 2)The Streamlit app will automatically connect to the running FastAPI server.Open a new, separate terminal (Terminal 2).Run the Streamlit application:Bashstreamlit run app_frontend.py
Expected Outcome: A new browser window will open, displaying the interactive prediction interface (usually at http://localhost:8501).Alternative: Run with Docker Compose (Recommended for Production)For containerized deployment, run the following command in your terminal to build and start both services simultaneously:Bashdocker compose up --build -d
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8501.📁 Project File StructureFile/FolderDescriptionapi_service.pyBackend: FastAPI server that loads the model and exposes the /predict endpoint.app_frontend.pyFrontend: Streamlit web application that captures user input and calls the FastAPI API.requirements.txtLists all necessary Python dependencies (for both services).delinquency_model.joblibThe serialized Logistic Regression model (the brain of the service).training_data.csvThe cleaned dataset used for training the model.✨ Core Features & ModelingFeatures UsedThe MVP model was intentionally kept simple, relying on three highly predictive features derived from the historical data:Current_Utilization_Rate: (Most Recent Bill Amount / Credit Limit)Minimum_Payment_Flag: Proxy for high financial stress (1 if minimum payment used/late, 0 otherwise).Days_Since_Last_Payment_Proxy: The most recent numeric repayment status code (PAY_0).Model PerformanceModel Type: Logistic RegressionEvaluation Metric: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)Result: AUC $\approx 0.7097$ on the test set.💡 Potential EnhancementsTo move this MVP to an enterprise-ready system, consider these next steps:Model Upgrade: Replace Logistic Regression with XGBoost to boost the AUC score above $0.80$.Advanced Features: Implement velocity features (e.g., % change in payment amount over 3 months) to capture earlier risk signals.Security: Implement basic API key authentication for the /predict endpoint.
